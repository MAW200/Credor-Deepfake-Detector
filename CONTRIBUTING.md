# Contributing to Credor (frontend)

Thanks for your interest in contributing! The following guidelines will help your PR get merged quickly.

Code style
- Use TypeScript for new code.
- Run and fix lint issues before submitting (`npm run lint` or `npx eslint .`).

Workflow
- Fork the repository and create a branch named `feature/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
- Keep changes small and focused. One feature or bug per PR.
- Include a short description of your changes and why they were made in the PR body.

Testing & QA
- Manual smoke test: run the app locally and exercise the new screens or flows.
- If you add tests, include instructions to run them in the PR.

Commit messages
- Use clear, present-tense messages (e.g., `Add facial scan hook` or `Fix crash on settings save`).

Licensing and CLA
- By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (see `LICENSE`).

If you want help setting up a local dev environment or adding CI, open an issue and I can assist.
